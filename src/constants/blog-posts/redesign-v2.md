# Big design change

After getting feedback from the wonderful Tomohiro Loeer (Tomo)

## Reflecting on the purpose

I want people to see this and 1) hire me as a product consultant, 2) hire me as a design thinking consultant, 3) book me to speak, &/or 4) learn more about me and realize how cool I am.

## Process Thoughts

I just tossed something out for my home page where I outline my services, but I'm not quite happy with it. Tomo suggested that I incorporate more of a story element in and try to give it the "sab pizzazz". I'm proud of the graphics I created to represent each service, but it still feels very lame.

I think I ought to bring a picture of me back to the forefront so it's clear whose website this is, maybe I'll include it in the top right? Typing out loud here.
