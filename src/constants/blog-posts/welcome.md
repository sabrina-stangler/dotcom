# Welcome to my website!

This website has been a project for me to build some confidence and (shockingly) have some fun.

## Some Background 

Having graduated in 2020 with a BS in Software Engineering, been employed as a developer for the last five years, and spoken on software-related subjects over a dozen times - I FINALLY feel like I have a firm grasp on software engineering.

.

I only realized this as I approached building my personal website for the dozenth time. But this time was different - I was pursuing a career as a freelance developer, which meant it was time to get my shit together.

.

To my surprise, I seemed to have my shit together quite nicely. Clearly a switch finally flicked on transitioning me from a novice to, _dare I say_, an expert?

.

Every other attempt to build a website on my own has flopped tremendously. So what is different this time? For one, I'm choosing a tech stack that's comfortable for me. I have been swayed by the glamour of an ultra-lightweight, super quick static site built using something like Gatsby or Remix. This always meant learning something new, fighting with existing styles and structure from templates, and often getting confined to the product's own documentation. 

.

This time, I started with stuff I knew. My website is not the lightest weight or the fastest. It's not connected to a CMS or using a style library. It's the create-react-app project, deployed via Github pages (good documentation), and designed entirely by me!

.

This time, I know what I want to build and how to build it. I'm better practiced at doing things one step at a time instead of trying to make the whole content-rich website all at once. I'm also a more capable & confident designer.

.

Most importantly: I feel like I'm having fun designing the pages & flow, figuring out how to build it, and even showing it off to get feedback.

## My Expert Era

My experience of the world has taught me to be meek, quiet, and small. That's what will keep me safe. 

.

I write this now, saying confidently with my chest: I am a really good engineer. I'm a proven problem solver. I'm creative, innovative & adaptive.

.

Perhaps I'll add more to this post, but I'll leave it here for now. V1, iterations to come.
